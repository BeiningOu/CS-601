          <h4>Best friend</h4>
          <p>
            Juliet is Beining's best friend. She follows Beining everywhere as
            if she always wants to check whether is it safe for Beining. She
            doesn't like Beining's baby Sammy that much, but, I don't blame her
            -- Sammy always steals her treats and grabs her toys.
