        <h4>Best friend</h4>
        <p>
          Juliet is Beining's best friend. She follows Beining everywhere as if
          she always wants to check whether is it safe for Beining. She doesn't
          like Beining's baby Sammy that much, but, I don't blame her -- Sammy
          always steals her treats and grabs her toys.
