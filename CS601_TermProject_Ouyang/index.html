          Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Beining Ouyang, and I am an
          M.S. student at Boston University, major in Software development. I am
          graduating in 2023 Spring and currently looking for job opportunities
          as software engineer. I have strong knowledge of CS fundamentals, an
          engineering background, and programming skills. For languages, I know
          python, Java, JavaScript, HTMLâ€¦ I am hard-working and self-motivated.
          I am also a quick learner! Although I don't have much industry working
          experience as a software engineer, I can pick up new things quickly! I
          originally come from China. I had my bachelor's degree at the South
          China University of Technology in 2016, majoring in Food Science and
          Engineering. After college, I went to Penn State to pursue my first
          M.S. degree in Agriculture and Biological Engineering (2017 Fall -2019
          Spring). At Penn State, I worked in Dr. Ali Demirci's lab and did my
          microbiology research. That is where I learned to become a
          researcher---writing proposals, designing and conducting experiments,
          data collection and analysis, technical writing, and presentations.
          Most importantly, how to think like a researcher. After two year's
          research and study, I graduated in 2019 Spring and published three
          papers and one book chapter with my advisor Dr. Ali Demirci.

        <h4 class="midTitle">More about Beining</h4>
        <p>
          Beining lives in Methuen, MA with his husband Tom, their 15-month-old
          boy Sammy, and her best friend - Juliet (Cat). She originally comes
          from China, and she loves cooking Chinese food, especially spicy food!
          When she got some free time, she likes playing piano and singing
          songs. Her favorite family activity recently is going to a playground
          called "Filed of Dream" in NH with her 15-month-old.
