        <p>
          Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Beining Ouyang, and I am an
          M.S. student at Boston University, major in Software development. I am
          graduating in 2023 Spring and currently looking for job opportunities
          as software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have strong knowledge of CS fundamentals, an engineering background,
          and programming skills. For languages, I know python, Java,
          JavaScript, HTML… I am hard-working and self-motivated. I am also a
          quick learner! Although I don't have much industry working experience
          as a software engineer, I can pick up new things quickly!
        </p>

        <p id="read-more-main">Read more about me.</p>
        <div id="read-more-hide">
          <p>
            I originally come from China. I had my bachelor's degree at the
            South China University of Technology in 2016, majoring in Food
            Science and Engineering. After college, I went to Penn State to
            pursue my first M.S. degree in Agriculture and Biological
            Engineering (2017 Fall -2019 Spring).
          </p>
          <p>
            At Penn State, I worked in Dr. Ali Demirci's lab and did my
            microbiology research. That is where I learned to become a
            researcher---writing proposals, designing and conducting
            experiments, data collection and analysis, technical writing, and
            presentations. Most importantly, how to think like a researcher.
            After two year's research and study, I graduated in 2019 Spring and
            published three papers and one book chapter with my advisor Dr. Ali
            Demirci.
          </p>

          />

          <p>
            After Penn State, I worked at Xenon Corporation for one year and a
            half. At Xenon, I was with the engineering team, doing research and
            customized testing. My responsibility includes developing test
            protocols for different biological challenges; performing biological
            testing; writing reports and presenting internally and externally.
          </p>

          <p>
            With great interest and passion for software and programming, I
            decided to get another M.S degree in software development.
            Therefore, I got into Boston University and now I am in my last year
            of the program. Courses I took at Boston University include
            “information structures with python”, “data structures and
            algorithms”, “software design and patterns”, “information systems
            analysis and design” and “web application development” …
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I live in a Boston suburb -- Methuen, MA -- with my husband, our
            boy, and our cat. It is a small town and very convenient in terms of
            living and transportation. I love cooking Chinese food, especially
            spicy food! When we got some free time, I will play piano and sing
            songs. My favorite family activity recently is going to a playground
            called "Filed of Dream" in NH.

            <p>My life philosophy is true love, curiosity, and hard-working.</p>
            <p>True love always gives me the power to keep going.</p>
            <p>Curious keeps me learning continuously.</p>
            <p>Hard-working... I believe in it.</p>
